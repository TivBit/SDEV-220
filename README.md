BUG REPORT: 
    * It took a little while for me to get the syntax down.
    * There were issues with the print statements, because I was not forming the string correctly. 
    * Added requirements.txt file.  Didn't add this file to the initial code.  If file was not added, pip would not be able to run the code.
